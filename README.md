Crypto Watch is an app that makes crypto easy and accessible. It allows anyone to keep a pulse on the market that never sleeps.

The goal of this project is to simplify the complexity of the crypto market by drowing out the noise and eliminating the intimidation.

We want to help others understand and learn in a safe and simple environment. That way they can join in on the conversation and get involved.

Innovation starts with a conversation.
